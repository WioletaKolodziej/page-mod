#page-mod
This project is a modernization of the 007 Muzeum page, developed as part of my portfolio.

Key Features and Improvements:
	•	Modern Web Structure: Utilizes semantic HTML5 elements (`<header>`, `<main>`, `<section>`, `<nav>`, `<footer>`) to improve document structure and accessibility.
	•	Accessibility (a11y): Designed with keyboard navigation in mind, proper ARIA labels, focus management, and meaningful alt texts for images, ensuring the site is usable by people with disabilities.
	•	High Contrast and Readability: Uses clear typography with proper contrast ratios, and readable font sizes. Color choices ensure comfort and comply with modern accessibility guidelines.
	•	Simple and Minimalist Design: Clean layout with a dark color palette inspired by modern platforms, focusing on usability and content without clutter.
	•	Responsive: Layout adapts smoothly to different screen sizes using CSS Grid and Flexbox.
	•	Smooth Interactions: Hover and focus effects provide subtle feedback.
	•	External Asset URLs: References to images use full URLs from the official domain, avoiding the need for local hosting or manual image transfer.
	•	Performance-conscious: Optimized embedding of videos, minimal decorative effects, and careful use of CSS properties for efficient rendering.

 This modernization follows the best practices of modern web development in 2025, emphasizing user experience, accessibility, and clean code.
This project shows a practical application of up-to-date standards in web accessibility, design, and development suitable for portfolio demonstration or production use.
